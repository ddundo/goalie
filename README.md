## Pyroteus Goal-Oriented Mesh Adaptation Toolkit

[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)

Pyroteus provides metric-based goal-oriented mesh
adaptation functionality to the Python-based finite
element library [Firedrake][firedrake]. The 'y' is
silent, so its pronunciation is identical to
'Proteus' - the ancient Greek god of the constantly
changing surface of the sea.

The Pyroteus documentation is hosted at [pyroteus.github.io/](https://pyroteus.github.io/).

This is research of the Applied Modelling and
Computation Group ([AMCG][amcg]) at Imperial College
London.
