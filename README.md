Pyroteus provides metric-based goal-oriented mesh adaptation functionality to the Python-based 
[Firedrake finite element library](https://firedrakeproject.org). The 'y' is silent, so its
pronunciation is identical to 'Proteus' - the ancient Greek god of the constantly changing
surface of the sea.

The Pyroteus documentation is hosted at [pyroteus.github.io/](https://pyroteus.github.io/).
